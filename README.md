# Area Locked Chests
This is a locked chest that check protections, to allow sharing chests easily.

Though named "[Area](https://content.minetest.net/packages/ShadowNinja/areas/)"-Locked Chests, this mod should be compactible with all protection mods respecting `minetest.is_protected` and `minetest.record_protection_violation`.

The screenshot shows an Area-Locked Chests, with an [Area Protector Block](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Emojiminetest/protect_block_area/) that is not included in this mod.
